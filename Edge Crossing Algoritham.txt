Edge Crossing Algoritham
Initialize a Counter: Set a counter to zero. This counter will keep track of the number of times edges cross each other.

Get All Edges: Retrieve a list of all the edges in the graph.

Compare Each Pair of Edges: For each edge in the list, compare it with every other edge. This is done by looping through the list of edges twice:

The first loop picks the first edge.
The second loop picks another edge to compare with the first one.
Check for Intersection: For each pair of edges, check if they intersect. This involves several sub-steps:

Find the start and end points of both edges.
Use these points to determine if the two line segments formed by these edges intersect.
Count Intersections: If two edges intersect, increase the counter by one.

Calculate Intersection for Line Segments: To check if two line segments intersect, perform the following calculations:

Calculate differences in x and y coordinates for both segments.
Compute the determinant to see if the lines are parallel.
If not parallel, calculate two parameters (t1 and t2) to check the intersection within the segment's length.
Determine the Final Count: Once all pairs of edges have been compared, the counter reflects the total number of intersecting pairs of edges in the graph.
